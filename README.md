# header-image-parallax
Super basic script to enable a parallax scrolling effect on site header images

## Benefits
1. Very minimal code is required
2. Doesn't require a massive image - image only needs to be the exact size that it is shown at
3. Can be used on `<img>` tags - better for SEO

### Limitations
1. Can only be used on a header image that is at the top of the page

### Usage
1. Just add this into your sites main scripts file
2. Ensure you have an element called `#header` with an image tag in it
i.e. `<header id='header'><img src='http://placehold.it/1920x350' /></header>`
